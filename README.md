# Sudoku Solver 🧩
Welcome to **Sudoku Solver**, a Python-based project to solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. Whether you're stuck on a Sudoku puzzle or just want to have fun with coding, this project has got you covered!

# Features 🌟
- **Solve any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle** with missing values (represented as 0s).
- Uses a **backtracking algorithm** for efficient and recursive solving.
- **Customizable puzzles**: Just modify the input grid to solve any Sudoku problem.
- Simple, easy-to-read code for anyone interested in learning **algorithm design** and **Python**.

# Installation 💻
Clone the repository:
- git clone [https://github.com/Kanason/sudoku-solver.git](https://github.com/LeMages/Sudoku-Solver.git)
- cd sudoku-solver

Run the solver:
- python sudoku_solver.py

# Usage 🚀
You can modify the grid directly in the code or supply it through a different input method.

The goal is to fill the grid following the Sudoku rules, ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears only once in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid.

# How It Works 🛠️
The backtracking algorithm recursively tries each possible number in each empty cell (0s) and checks for Sudoku rule violations. If a violation occurs, the algorithm backtracks to the previous step and tries a different number. This process continues until the puzzle is solved or determined unsolvable.
